# CS373 week 3 notes
Week ending 2018-02-02

## 1/29
### Black box vs white box testing
unit tests = white box testing
acceptance tests = black box testing

### Meta cache
Store cycle lengths for arbitrary ranges 
eg: precompute max cycle length of  [1,1000] [1000-2000] [2000-3000] [3000-4000] and hard code that as a dictionary
to calculate max cycle length [1500-3500]
* compute mcl 1500-2000, look up 2000-3000, compute mcl of 3000-3500

### Exceptions
Allow functions to communicate with each other
```
def f(…):
	if <condition>: 
		raise E(…)

def g(...):
	...
	try:
		...
		x = f(...)
	except (Case):
		<something wrong>
	...
```

When dealing with parent -> child exception blocks always catch the child first

The else clause of a try/except blocks ill only run when no exception is raised, finally will always run.
