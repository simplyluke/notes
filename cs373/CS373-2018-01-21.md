# CS373 2018-01-21 week 1 notes
## Day 1 1/17
Lots of flexibility on projects in terms of technical implementation 
Python + flask used throughout, as well as java, javascript, and sql
tests are done on hacker rank
lab sessions w/th 6-8PM in the GDC 3rd floor lab

## Day 2 1/19
### Docker
Images for class available on docker hub, example of setting up and using a docker image is available on course website.

### Collatz Conjecture
take a positive integer, if itâ€™s even divide by 2, else multiply by 3 and add 1
repeat until 1
he gives an example implementation and testing with asserts in python 3.6 and uses the new type annotations on python, which are pretty cool
Likes using asserts for pre and post conditions, but stresses need of a proper unit test framework for unit testing due to the fact that your entire suite should continue executing if one test fails.
