# CS373 week 2 notes
Week ending 2018-01-28

## 1/22
### Announcements 
* Project 1 open, due next thursday 
* Downing also teaches/leads competitive programming 
### Collatz project
* Can submit on hacker rank as many times as we want, no cost associated 
* python 3.5.2
steps (all listed on website)
1. Create GitHub classroom repo 
	1. create and close issues in that repo
2. assertions, pylon results, autopep8
3. 100-200 lines of tests
4. 10-20 unit tests, coverage results
5. pydoc collatz.py

We’re doing TDD - write the tests first
Memoizing results will be a big gain
### REPL
Read eval print loop
run harness should read/write to stdin/stdout but tests shouldn’t 

Test code is broken but passes all tests right now
### Steps
1. Run code as is to see green tests
2. Fix acceptance and unit tests
3. Run code to see red
4. fix code
5. run code to see green

“Solve the damn problem… don’t be clever”
## 1/24
### Quiz notes/optimizations 
“if odd multiply by 3 and add 1” can be simplified from (3n+1)/2 to `n + (n >> 1) + 1` remember to increment the cycle length by **2**
for b,e m = e/2 + 1
if b < m `max_cycle(b, e) = max_cycle (m,e)` 

### Js notes
Brandon Each 1995

### Workflow
1. Estimate time to completion 
	1. Difficult to do well, but good to get used to it so we can improve
	2. not graded on accuracy of estimate
2. 10 of the GH issues come from workflow list
3. fork to your own private repo and work there, merge back in to push to travis 
4. issues will be in classroom repo tracker

### caching
**lazy caching** Remember values you’ve been asked for
**eager caching** Precompute results

## 1/26
### Testing
We’re using selenium for frontend acceptance tests
### python unit tests
test names must begin with `test`
### self
first argument to method in python, not a keyword (can be whatever self is just convention) refers to the class object
### Mocha
JS testing framework we’ll use
### Coverage
percent of code covered by tests
