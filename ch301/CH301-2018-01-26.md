## light as a wave
Inversely proportional to mass

* diffraction is a property of waves
* light diffracts when passing through slits
* waves can also diffract if they scatter off something - anything that produces radiating waves that can interfere with each other.
* Three years after de broglie proposed matter waves Thomson and Davisson confirmed it by shooting a beam of electrons through a material and observing a diffraction pattern as the electron waves were diffracted by the atoms in the material. Shared 1937 Nobel. Thomsons father won the 1907 nobel for discovering the electron
* electrons, much like photons, can be thought of as both a particle and a wave
* SEM (scanning electron microscopy) scatters electrons off the surface of a sample, and uses the scattered angles and energies to create a 3D image
* TEM (transmission electron microscopy) passes a beam of electrons through a thin slice of sample, analogous to light microscopy. Can be used to see things at a far smaller level than with a traditional light microscope 
### Atomic Spectroscopy
* Newton first used a prism to disperse wavelengths of sunlight in the 17th century. Sunlight, light bulbs, hot body radiation all emit “white” or continuous light
* If you disperse the light given off by a gas discharge tube the emission spectrum you see consists of light at only very specific wavelengths. 

## Demonstration of atomic emission
Hydrogen, Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon 

## Spectrums

An **emission spectrum** most often occurs for gases and requires energy input so it’s inconvenient to measure in the lab
An **absorption spectrum** is the inverse and is easier to measure 

## Rydberg Equation
An *empirical* formula fits experimental data, but has no theoretical explanation 
Several experimentalists found empirical formulae that seemed to fit the observed lines in the hydrogen emission spectrum. We’re studying Rydberg’s model of the hydrogen spectrum emission 

Wavelengths 
1 / λ = R(1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

v = c / λ = cR (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

Energy can be calculated too
deltaE = R(1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

Rydberg’s equation was found to be applicable to any atom *with only one electron* when the following change is made:
deltaE = R * Z^2 (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)

Where Z is the atomic number of the atom
Doesn’t explain why it works 

## Bohr Atomic Model
In 1913, Niels Bohr created an atomic model incorporating Planck and Einstein’s new ideas. His model was the first to explain both atomic emission spectra, and Rydberg’s empirical formula.

Bohr described the electron of a hydrogen atom orbiting the nucleus like he Rutherford atom with these changes:
* The electron’s energy is quantized
* electrons can only occupy specific orbits each corresponding to a different value of the quantum number n
* each orbit corresponds to a different electron energy
* lower energy orbitals are smaller diameter hence closer to the nucleus 

**Write down the equation** 
The lowest possible energy level  n =1 is closest 
Electron is stable at n=1. Known as **Ground state**
Upper orbitals are known as **excited states**

Energy of an emitted photon is difference between energy of initial state and final state
