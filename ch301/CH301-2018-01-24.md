The **photoelectric effect** is the emission of electrons from a metal when its  hit by light
There is a threshold frequency below which no electrons will be emitted no matter how intense the light is. Different metals have different threshold frequencies. Higher frequency results in faster electrons, and high intensity light produces more electrons.

Einsein explained the photoelectric effect by saying light sometimes behaves as particles, photos, each with quantized energy.

`E = hv = (hc) / lamda `

Example: 
What is the energy in joules of a single quantum of green light
```
λv = c

v  = c / λ = (3x10^8 ms^-1)/(520x10^9 m) = 5.77x10^14 s^-1

E = hv  = 6.626x10^024Js x 5.77x10^14 s^-1
= 3.82x10^19J
```

## light as a wave
When two waves meet they interfere

Wave in phase (peaks of one line up with other) -> constructive interference (double the wave)

Wave out of phase (peaks opposite) -> waves cancel 

## Wave-particle duality

particles have wave-like properties too
Louis de Broglie won Nobel for suggesting this
calculate wavelength from mass and velocity
h is joule seconds 
`λ = h / (mv)` (note that’s v velocity not v frequency)

lamda = 6.62607004 × 10-34 m2 kg / s / (5.2kg * 1.6ms^-1)

lamda =hc/  4.085625e-19 = 6.626x10^34 Js (2.9979x10^8ms) /
