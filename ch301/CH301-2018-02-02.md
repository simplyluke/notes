**Exam wed night** 
Sample exam this afternoon
Content from today/monday on exam. Wednesday lecture = review

Bring calc, ID, pencils, *can’t leave for bathroom*

Reviewing schrodingers from last time

`If an electron mass 9.11 x 10^-31kg is confined to a 1d box 200pm in length what wavelength of light will excited from teh ground state to the first excited state?`
(see notes 1/31)

To find wavelength (lamda = hc / e = …. 44nm )

“It’s going to be on the test”

Solutions to 3D schrodingers given in *sperical polar* coordinates 

3 quantum numbers: 
* Principal quantum number n
* angular momentum quantum number l (in cursive)
* magnetic quantum number ml (l in cursive) 

Each unique combination of these identifies a different orbital which has its own wave function 
* n has integer values 1,2,3…
* n names the shell 
* as n increases the size of the orbitals increase ie the electron spends more time far from nucleus 
* as increase less tightly bound to nucleus and has more energy

l designates the sub shell electron is occupying
l
0 -> s
1 -> p
2 -> d 
3 -> f
4 -> g

magnetic quantum number: ml

can have integer values: ml = -l…l
the orientation in space of each orbital can be predicted from the value of ml 

Know allowed values for the various quantum numbers
