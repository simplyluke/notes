## The EMG Spectrum
**Refraction** is the change in direction of a wave as it enters a different medium. e.g. the difference in angle as light enters water

Energy needed to eject an electron is the **work function** 

`hv = Φ + 1/2mv^2` or rewritten `1/2mv^2 = hv - Φ`
photon energy = energy to eject an electron + kinetic energy
