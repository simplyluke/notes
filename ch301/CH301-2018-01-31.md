## Wave mechanics 
Standing wave is a wave that appears to be still (like a guitar string)

## Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle 
How can you determine the “position” of a wave?

Unable to describe a particle with both definite position and definite momentum

The uncertainty of a macroscopic object is way too small to measure (here’s where the woo-woo around quantum starts to fall apart)

As mass gets smaller uncertainty increases

The uncertainty in position of an electron is close to the size of an atom which means we cannot locate the position of an electron in an atom with certainty

We will discuss **probability distributions** to describe location of an electron

* Energy is quantized
* Matter and radiation have a dual nature, whether they behave as waves or particles depends on the type of experiment we do
* It is impossible to know the values of certain pairs of properties as precisely as you may wish
* Don’t know exactly where electrons are

## Quantum Mechanics
A **wavefunction** is a mathematical description of the wave properties of a system and is represented by the greek later Psi Ψ

A  wave function is a function of the coordinates (x, y z) of the particles position Ψ(x,y,z) is the  amplitude (size) of the wave at every point in three dimensional space

The **probability density** is the square of the wave function Ψ^2(x,y,z) calculated at a particular point in space and is related to the *probability of finding the particle at that particular point in space* 

### Schrodinger formula
HΨ = EΨ
H is the **hamiltonian** and is a mathematical operator or set of functions that are applied to Ψ

The hamiltonian used depends on what system you are trying to describe and includes terms for the potential kinetic energy of the system

For any system there are an infinite number of solutions to Schrodinger equation each solution consists of a wave function and an energy, that is the total energy of the system when it is describe by that particular wavefucntion 

Shcrodinger eq for single particle in 3D

(-h2^2 / 8pi^2m) (o^2Ψ / ox^2 + o^2Ψ / oy^2 + o^2Ψ / oz^2) + vΨ = EΨ

The o functions are kinetic energy in 3D, vΨ is potential energy
For an electron orbiting an atom each different electron wave function is called an orbital and the system energy … go back to slides

*don’t need to actually do any of this math*

### 1D particle in a box
 Simplest application of Schrodingers eq
particle in box that is L wide
this is *not* a hydrogen atom

The potential inside the box is zero and the potential at either end of the box is infinite… electron is forced to stay in the box 

Electron can only move in one dimension (x) between x=0 and x=L

Start w/ simplifying Shcrodinger eq to 1D and set potential to zero

-h^2/ 8pi^2m = d^2Ψ/ dx^2 = EΨ
… more math on slides she’s skipping it

While solving eq must satisfy
1. Ψ at each wall of the box must be zero (standing wave won’t form unless there’s anode at either end)
2. electron cannot escape box so total portability that electron can be found in the box is one (integral of Ψ^2 over the length of the box equal to one)

solution for particle in 1D box

En = n^2*h^2 / 8mL^2
Ψn = sqrt(2/L) sin(n*pi/L * x)

Questions
1. How many wavelengths are in box given n — Ψn
2. Where is particle most/least likely to be given n — Ψ^2
3. what is energy value of particle given n — En

If an electron m = 9.11x10^-31kg is confined to a 1D box 200pm in length what wavelength of light will excite from the ground state to the first excited state 

deltaE = E2-E1 = 2^2*h^2 / 8mL^2 - 1^1*h^2/8mL^2 = (4-1) * h^2/8mL^2 = ( 3 * (6.626x10^-34kgm^2s^-2)^2) / (8 ( 9.11x10^-31kg)(200x10^-12m)^2) = 4.518 x10 ^-18J

“When you do a calc on exam and you see one of the answers matches don’t assume you got it right… every one one is the right all others are ones you could get w/ incorrect calculations.. check w/ unit analysis”
