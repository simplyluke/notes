## The rutherford atom
Early history of chemistry - model of atoms in 1911 consisted of central core with most of mass and half of the charge of the atom surrounded by a cloud of electrons 
Limitations included:
* Didn’t explain why elements have different properties
* Didn’t explain chemical bonding
* Didn’t explain stoichiometry
* Orbiting electrons should have radiated energy and slowly plummeted into the core
* Didn’t explain why atoms of different elements emit unique colors when electric passed through them or when burned
Quest to solve this lead to modern/quantum mechanics

## Electromagnetic Radiation
Wavelengths (lamda) 
Frequency (greek nu (lil v))
larger wavelength = smaller frequency 
c = 2.9979249x10^8 ms^-1 
	for our calculations we can use c = 3.00 x 10^8 ms^-1

## Unit prefixes we’re expected to know
giga
mega
kilo
milli
micro
nano
pico

## Blackbody Radiation
Color is based on what temperature the body is - we can use this to determine the temperature of the stars.
