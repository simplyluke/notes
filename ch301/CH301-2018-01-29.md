## Exam prep
* Next wednesday
* almost guaranteed to be a “which has the greatest number of hydrogen atoms"
	* “Have no fear of ice `cl`old `br`eer” are diatomic 

## Where are we 
Rydberg’s formula matches the emission of one-electron atoms, but didn’t explain what was happening
The Bohr model used the ides of Planck and Einstein, agreed with Rydberg and fitted observations

Blackbody radiation: `deltaE = nhv`: quantized energy
Photoelectron effect: einstein: `E = hv`: photons
Electron diffraction: de Broglie effect *get equation memorized* blackbody radiation 

## Bohr atomic amodel
When the electron moves from one orbital to another it *makes a transition*

`deltaE = Efinal - Einitial = E1 - E2`

`Ei = -2.178 x 10^-18J (1/ni^2) `
What is the energy lost when an electron moves from the n=4 to n=2 energy level of hydrogen
`deltaE = -2.178 x 10^-18J (1/2^2 - 1/4^2)`
`= -4.085x10^-14J`

When an electron makes a transition from higher n to a lower n the difference in energy is lost as a photon: **Emission**

When an electron makes a transition from a lower n to a higher n level the difference in energy comes from a photon: **Absorption** 
in the case of absorption we also say that the photo has **excited** the electron

If an electron gains by absorbing it will have a positive delta

atom is **ionized** when n= infinity
`Einfinity = 0 `

Bohr model ended up being disproven 

Wave mechanics: Heisenberg, de Broglie, Schrodinger started developing what was quantum mechanics 

A **standing wave** is a wave that appears to be stationary - commonly formed from interference between waves moving in opposing directions (think bass interference from walls)
