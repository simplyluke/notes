## First-Class Functions
“A first class value is a value that can be used anywhere”
It can be passed to a function, returned from a function, etc. Integers are first class values. 

Functions aren’t necessarily first class values 
`f(x) = x + 1`

Lamda notation/calculus 
f = λ x.x+1
g(x,y) = X + 2y
==  `g = λ x.(λ y.x+2y)`
g(3,7) == (g(3))(y)
“g is going to be applied to x first, that’s going to return a function (lamda y) that we’re going to apply to 7”
no reason to need parens
g 3 7

space = function application with high precedence and left associativity 


“multiple parameters but they get passed one at a time”

### λ calculus 
e = v
	| λv.e
	| e1 e2
	| (e)

((λa.(λb.b)) x) y

not = λb.b F T

where false and true are 

```
T = λa.λb.a
F = λa.λb.b

T x y -> x
F x y -> y
```

“Free variables of A” 
Fv(X) = {x}
FV(λx.A) = FV(A) - {x}
fv(e1e2) = fv(e1) v fv(e2)
fv(λa.λb.x b) = {x}


#### Example: 
And T T = T
And T F = F
And F T = F
And F F = F
And = λb1.λb2.b1 b2 F
Or  = λb1.λb2.b2 T b2
