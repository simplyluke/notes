# CS345 2018-01-19 Haskell
He’s teaching from (and recommends) [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). Already own - should work ahead some this weekend.
## GHCI
`:l` to load/compile a file and be able to call its functions
`:r` will reload the file
## Functions
calling  a function is done such as `doubleMe 9` which returns 18 
`doubleMe x = x * x `
camelCase the names
left associative 

## Whitespace
Haskell is indentation sensitive  
use indents to break functions into lines, much like python
## If statements 
`doubleSmallNumber x = (if x > 100 then x else x*2) + 1`
## Lists
`lostNumbers = [4,8,16]`
`l = 1: [2,  3,  4]`
`:` is the cons operator  - right associative 
`l’ = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : []`
### Concat
`++` operator
`cat = “Hello” ++ “World”`
## Comments
`—-` inline 
## Strings
Lists of chars
