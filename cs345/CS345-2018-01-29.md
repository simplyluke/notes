`area t(n*2l) -> area, t, (, n, *, 2l, )`
grammer 
```
E: E + E  {plus $1 $3}
	| E * E {mult $1 $3}
	| v     {var $1}
	| num   {const $1}
	| (E)   {$2}

* higher precedence than +
_, * left associative 
```

We’ll get a parse tree that tells us the precedence 
```
				E
			  / | \
			E   +	E 
			|     / |  \
		  area   (  E   )
				  / | \	
				E   *  E
				|	   |
				v      (
              |      |
			    "n"    2l
				
```
Order of the grammar does *not* determine structure of the AST - need more info in the grammar to do that

Sometimes you can get rules like `v ? E` in a grammar, what does that do? `n+2 ? 3` is **not** a valid grammar because it has to be a variable before the question mark
